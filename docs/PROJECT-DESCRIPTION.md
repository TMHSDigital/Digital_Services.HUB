Project Overview: Digital Services HUB

This project appears to be a web-based platform offering various digital tools and services. Based on the file structure and names, it seems to include several standalone tools accessible through a common interface.

Project Structure:

1. Root Directory:
   - index.html (main entry point)
   - LICENSE file

2. CSS Directory:
   - ascii-art.css
   - color-palette.css
   - image-resizer.css
   - qr-generator.css
   - styles.css (likely the main stylesheet)

3. JavaScript Directory (js):
   - ascii-art.js
   - color-palette.js
   - common.js (shared functionality across pages)
   - image-resizer.js
   - qr-generator.js

4. HTML Pages Directory (pages):
   - about.html
   - ascii-art.html
   - color-palette.html
   - image-resizer.html
   - qr-generator.html

5. Images Directory:
   - Contains .png file(s)

6. Docs Directory:
   - FUTURE-FEATURES.md
   - README.md

7. Configuration:
   - config.yml

Main Features:

1. Image Resizer: Allows users to resize images.
2. Color Palette Generator: Likely generates color schemes or palettes.
3. ASCII Art Converter: Converts images or text into ASCII art.
4. QR Code Generator: Creates QR codes from input data.
5. About Page: Provides information about the project or services.

Recent Updates:
- We've added localStorage functionality to common.js to allow for saving user preferences and recent operations across sessions.
- The navigation is dynamically generated in common.js, ensuring consistency across all pages.

Key Components:

1. common.js: 
   - Handles site-wide functionality like navigation.
   - Includes localStorage utilities for data persistence.

2. Tool-specific JS files (e.g., image-resizer.js):
   - Contain the core logic for each tool.
   - Have been updated to use localStorage for saving user preferences.

3. HTML files:
   - Provide the structure for each tool's interface.
   - Link to both common and tool-specific CSS and JS files.

4. CSS files:
   - Style the interface for each tool and the overall site.

Next Steps:

1. Review and update each tool-specific JS file to implement localStorage functionality similar to image-resizer.js.
2. Ensure all HTML files are properly structured and linked to the correct CSS and JS files.
3. Test each tool thoroughly to ensure proper functionality and data persistence.
4. Consider implementing additional features or improvements as outlined in FUTURE-FEATURES.md.
5. Update the README.md with any new information about the project's features and usage.

This project appears to be a well-structured, modular web application providing various digital services. The use of separate HTML, CSS, and JS files for each tool allows for easy maintenance and scalability. The recent addition of localStorage functionality enhances user experience by remembering preferences and recent operations.
